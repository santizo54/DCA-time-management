# DCA-time-management

This pilot study utilizes discrete choice analysis (DCA) to explore how CSULB students allocate their labor and leisure time.

Particularly, this study used a mixed level discrete choice design with three factors: time split, type of labor, and type of leisure. Time split was divided by two hours of labor and six hours of leisure, six hours of labor and two hours of leisure, and four hours of both. Types of labor included school, work, or school and work. The data was collected from an introductory statistics course at CSULB.
